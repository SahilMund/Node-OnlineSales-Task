# Expression Evaluator and Occurrence Generator

This repository contains two functions: 

An Expression Evaluator and an Occurrence Generator. These functions are useful for different tasks related to mathematical expressions and event probabilities.

## Expression Evaluator

The Expression Evaluator is a function that accepts mathematical expressions and evaluates each expression using a specified API. It provides a convenient way to evaluate multiple expressions and display the results.

For detailed information and usage instructions, please refer to the [Expression Evaluator README](./task-2-expression-evaluator/README.md).

## Occurrence Generator

The Occurrence Generator is a function that generates occurrences based on given probabilities. It allows you to simulate events with biased probabilities, such as rolling a dice or flipping a coin.

For detailed information and usage instructions, please refer to the [Occurrence Generator README](./task-1/README.md).

## Installation

To use the Expression Evaluator and Occurrence Generator functions in your project, you can follow the installation instructions provided in their respective README files.
